What is React?
- React is a JavaScript Library/framework for building user interfaces. It was created by facebook
- Websites/UIs are looked at in terms of components
- React is currently the most popular out of the major front-end frameworks.

Why React
- React allows us to build very dynamic and interactive websites and user interfaces.
- Very fast, especially with the new compiler.
- There is a huge ecosystem from Next.js to React Native.
- Best framework to learn to get a job.

components
- Reusable piece of code that can e used to build elements on the page.
- Allows us to break down complex UIs, which makes them easier to maintain and scale.
- Components can get props passed in and can hold their own state.

State
- State represents the data that a component manages internally.
- This could be form input data, fetched data, UI-related data like if a modal is open/close.
- There is also global state, which relates to the app as a whole and not a single component.

Hooks
- Allows us to use state and other React features within functional components
- useState          - useEffect
- useRef            - useReducer

What is JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension)
-An HTML-like syntax within JavaScript (components)

SPA, SSR, & SSG:
* Single Page App - Load a single html file and JavaScript loads the entire UI including routes.
* Server-Side Rendered - Server sends fully rendered page to client. You can fetch data and load it as well.
* Static Site Generation - React generates statuc HTML files at build time. These are very fast
